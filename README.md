# HPC Workshop on Reproducible Package Management Workflows
Brought to you by the [SDSS Center for Computation](https://sdss-compute.stanford.edu) and [OpenSource@Stanford](https://opensource.stanford.edu/).
Thursday, Nov. 20th in CoDa W401 from 1-2pm

In today's workshop we are going to cover how to create reproducible package management containers that allow you to build, share, and run scientific software reliably across different HPC environments. This will provide you with a reliable framework to move your code between systems with confidence, reduce “it only works on my machine” issues when you share your code, and speed up your workflow setup on a new machine. We will be learning how to use Apptainer to containerize our package management, first in Python with `conda`, and then we'll expand this to show you how to do this in R with `renv`, and in Julia with `Pkg`.

### Today's Tutorial Agenda:
1. What is containerization and why is it useful for package management on HPC?
2. Building your first Apptainer container for Python using `conda`
3. Run a script with apptainer in shell mode
4. Run your first containerized batch job on Sherlock
5. Building an Apptainer container for R using `renv`
6. Building an Apptainer container for Julia using `Pkg`
